26 general cases of interest: 4 US; remainder from Ireland. The 4 US cases are
IRV elections reimagined as 2 seat STV elections. The Irish instances are 3+
seat STV elections reimagined as 2 seat STV elections.

Run basic general algorithm with max tv of any candidate at 2/3.

4/26 successes.

Run basic general algorithm with max tv set to 0.429.

5/26 successes.

Basic algorithm does incorporate the selective use of AGs in order to increase
the margins of NL assertions (or try to make them possible).

Given an alternate winner pair C1, C2. 

1) We want to show that there exists a candidate O \= C1 such that O NL C2.

In computing the maximum tally of C2, we need to determine how to count
ballots that move from C1 (surplus transfer) to C2. We can use 0.429 as a 
general maximum transfer value, but can we do better?

C1 cannot have a quota to start with and so must achieve that quota 
after an elimination of some candidate Z. 

Surplus of C1 when it gets a quota can be at most MaxTally(Z). Factoring in
that ballots that need to pass through a 'c' where 'c' AG Z would not be 
in Z's pile at the point of elimination (niether would ballots that preference
C1, C2, and O) before Z. 


Does not help enough (at the moment)

Oakland mayor. Winners are 13 and 2.

Outcome:
15,16,6,8,7,5,9,11,0,3,4,12,10,13,1,14,2
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1

We have a large number of eliminations until 13 gets a quota, and then candidate 2 is left at the end (does not achieve a quota). Candidate 13's actual
transfer value is 0.151628.

Alternate pair of interest is c1 = 12, c2 = 13 with o = 2. We want to show
that o = 2 NL c1 = 12 given c2 is assumed to get a seat.

Compute a smaller TV value for 13 on the basis of some Z (not in the list 
[c1,c2,o]) being eliminated.

    REV MAX TV for C1/C2 = 12, 13, o = 2, is 0.3738620423238548, asn 299

But even when using this lower TV value we cannot show that 2 (Actual winner)
never loses to 12 (Actual loser).

   (2) can we show that 2 NL 12?    [Assuming 13 elected]
      min tally 2 is 14608
      max tally 12 is 17112.718473627676
      no

With a transfer value of 0.429.

   (2) can we show that 2 NL 12? 
      min tally 2 is 14608
      max tally 12 is 17417.08
      no

If you force the max TV to 0.16 for 13, AND say that every ballot
that preferences 13 above 12 will have the TV applied, you can generate 
the 2 NL 12 assertion.

However, still have problems with other assertions:
ALT outcome pair 10,13
   (2) can we show that 2 NL 10? 
      min tally 2 is 14608
      max tally 10 is 20343.279999999995
      no
